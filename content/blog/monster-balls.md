## Introduction
As you can see pretty much everywhere in our website we really want to produce games that can be enjoy by the entire family. Not only our content has to be safe for everybody but additionally we want to appeal to everybody.

Because of this, we have been working hard to create a new skin for our first game [Balls and Bricks](/blog//2018/02/21/balls-bricks-game/) designed specially to appeal children of any age (even grown ups children like ourselves!).


## The Game!

The game is exactly like the first version but now instead of boring blocks you have gems that you can destroy with the help of these colorful friendly monsters.
