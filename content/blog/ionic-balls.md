## Introduction
After working on the [Family Friendly](/blog/2018/02/21/monster-balls/) version of [Balls and Bricks](/blog//2018/02/21/balls-bricks-game/) we couldn't help ourselves from creating one more skin and probably the last one.

We have been experimenting with neon/glowing techniques (after all our studio is called Glow Town...) and we couldn't resists the temptation of creating a version of our first game using these effects!


## The Game!

The game is exactly like the first version but now instead of boring colors the game is full of effects that accomplish a futuristic/space/glowing feeling.
