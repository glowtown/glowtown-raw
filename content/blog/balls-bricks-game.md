## Introduction
When you start a new studio some times the toughest thing to do is to decide where to start from. We had to pick which engine to use (We went with Unity) and what to build with it first. This time around we had no doubts though!

Two months ago we where all super hooked to this game that is some sort of a mix between breakout and puzzle bubble. We all hated some things from the game though. The controls were not great and the difficulty curve could be improved. So we decided to re-implement it greatly improving those areas.


## The Game!

The game is simple and self explainatory, in the screen you have blocks with a number and you have to hit them that many times to break them. Hit them with what you ask? With the balls you will be collecting.
