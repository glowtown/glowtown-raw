## Introduction

Our team loves crypto and we were not happy with the current price tracking applications available so we've built our own!

We took this as a weekend challenge and this is the result, a small, simple and "always on" application that sits the entire day as a notification
with the current amount of FIAT (Eurs, Dollars, etc...) you have invested so you can easily peak how your savings are doing.

## The Design

In the studio we are all hodlers and we are addicted into checking out what the current value (in FIAT) of our assets is. And that is what sits in the core
of our design.

The application features an easy workflow to add Assets:
